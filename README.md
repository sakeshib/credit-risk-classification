# credit-risk-classification

## Overview
This repository contains the solution to the Credit Risk Classification Challenge (Challenge 20). The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression model, to predict the likelihood of loans being healthy or high-risk. This analysis helps financial institutions assess loan risk more effectively.

## Description of the Files
The project is organized into the following folders and files:
- `credit_risk_classification.ipynb`: contains the completely analysis, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results
- `report-template.md`: contains a credit risk analysis report summarizing its findings
- `Resources`: contains the data in CSV format used for the analysis

## Resources Used
- Python (including libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and others)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Xpert Learning Assistant/ChatGPT

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Open the `credit_risk_classification.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the loan-risk analysis

## Results
The analysis demonstrated that the logistic regression model achieved the following metrics:
- Accuracy: 99%
- Precision:
    - Healthy loans: 100%
    - High-risk loans: 84%
- Recall:
    - Healthy loans: 99%
    - High-risk loans: 94%
- F-1 Score:
    - Healthy loans: 100%
    - High-risk loans: 89%
